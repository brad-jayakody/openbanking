### Prerequisites

Install node

### Installing

npm install

use nodemon as well (npm install nodemon)

start up - nodemon start


## Running the tests

Tests?  It barely works, let alone tests.

### And coding style tests

I didn't even use css, it's bloody tables.

## Authors

Myself.  This is probably why I don't write code any more at work.
